### Web Infrastructure Design
During a week-long project, I delved into the fascinating world of web infrastructure design. My research involved studying various design principles, and as I delved deeper, I meticulously constructed diagrams on a whiteboard, visualizing the evolution of a web infrastructure. Starting with a basic LAMP model, I gradually transformed it into a sophisticated, distributed system that boasted comprehensive monitoring and robust security measures.

To provide a comprehensive overview of my progress, each file in this project includes links to the corresponding whiteboard diagrams. Explore the journey of web infrastructure design and witness the development of a well-structured, resilient system.
